# Secondary Structure Prediction

Im trying to learn how to encode transformer-based ML models.

## Notes
[2026-06-01]: Basically the other notebook is a suboptimal to run on a computer. MOST OF THE TRANSFORMER CODE FROM HERE.

Length size of 72 was used because 1. It contains 700+ seq. 2.

This model is extremely inefficient as ive since learned. I decided to use a encoder-dcoder architecture, since I approached it as a "translation" problem, but after I built it I realsed it only requires new embeddings per residue.

[2026-06-03]: This architecture needs changing! Current encoder-decoder model is inefficient, and could be better solved using an encoder-only architecture. `Test Loss: 0.4879, Test Accuracy: 82.17%`

[2026-06-04]: After changing the architecture, we're getting marginally better results: `Test Loss: 0.8457, Test Accuracy: 82.06%` Changing DNN ReLU to GELU did marginally improve results.

Introducing a local convolution layer further improved our results: `Test Loss: 0.6680 Test Accuracy: 83.41%`

[2026-06-05]: Changed the embedding from 1-20 per amino acid and 0-7 for sst8 to one-hot embeddings. It did result in a drop in performance, but it is conceptually better. Test Loss: `0.8285 Test Accuracy: 74.94%`
